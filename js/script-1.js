//variables are how a programmin language stores information in a computer' memory

//declare variables
var myname;
console.log ("cow")


//var means storage of information in computer memory
//so if we type in (see below) 
var pet = ("dog") 
//We now learn the computer that a dog is a pet (I guess)
// We can say we've assigned the value "dog" to pet,
// and now pet contains the value "dog"
// the result
console.log(pet)

//CAMELCASE
//We use this to name variables
//Using this method, 
//the first word of a variable
// name starts with a lower case
// letter and subsequent words are
// joined to the first and begin with
// an upper case letter:
var loggedIn;
var orderHasShipped;
var lastName;

//JOINING STRINGS TOGHETER
//We can do this by using a + sing and is called concatenation
var letters = "a" + "b";
console.log(letters);
//"ab"

//

var firstName = "Mary"
var lastName = "Smith"
var fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;

console.log (fullName);
